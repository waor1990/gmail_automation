# Source Code Directory

- Contains application source code.
- Follow PEP 8 and use type hints.
- Include module and function docstrings describing behaviour and return types.
- Write unit tests for new code in the `tests/` directory.
- Avoid direct side effects at import time; use `if __name__ == "__main__":` for scripts.
