# ➕ “Add Missing Emails” Inline Action

These changes are to be implemented in the Dash dashboard.

- Add per-row action buttons in the Differences table to import missing emails directly.
- Preserve source casing and metadata (`read_status`, `delete_after_days`) when possible.
- Prevent duplicates by normalizing against current config.
