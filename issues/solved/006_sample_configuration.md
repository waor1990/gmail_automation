# Issue: Provide sample configuration without personal data

## Problem

New contributors need an example `gmail_config-final.json` but the current file contains personal labels and details.

## Proposed Solution

Create a sanitized sample configuration file (e.g. `gmail_config.sample.json`) illustrating the expected structure and document how to copy it for personal use.
