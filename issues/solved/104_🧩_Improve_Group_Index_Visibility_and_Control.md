# 🧩 Improve Group Index Visibility and Control

These changes are to be implemented in the Dash dashboard.

- Hide `group_index` by default for simpler editing.
- Add “Advanced Mode” toggle to expose grouping for power users.
- Consider UI widgets for **splitting/merging** groups instead of raw index editing.

**Priority**: High
**Labels**: dashboard, ux
