# Solved Issues Directory Guidelines

- Archive resolved issues as Markdown files.
- Name files with `NNN_issue-name.md` where NNN is the issue number.
- Begin each file with a short summary and reference commit or PR numbers.
- Group related attachments or assets in the same folder.
- Do not modify archived issues except to fix typos.
