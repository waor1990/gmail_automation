# Issue: Create a documentation directory

## Problem

Important information about configuration and usage is scattered across the README and issue files. There is no dedicated place for extended documentation or examples.

## Proposed Solution

Add a `docs/` directory containing guides on setup, configuration examples, and advanced usage. Link to these documents from the README to make the project easier to understand for new contributors.
