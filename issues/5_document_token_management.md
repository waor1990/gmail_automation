# Issue: Document Gmail API token management

## Problem
The process for obtaining and refreshing Gmail API tokens is unclear, making it difficult for new users to authenticate.

## Proposed Solution
Add a section to the README describing how to create credentials, authorize the application, and refresh expired tokens.
