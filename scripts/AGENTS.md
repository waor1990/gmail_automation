# Scripts Directory

- Store utility and helper scripts.
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated filenames for shell scripts and snake_case for Python scripts.
- Include a shebang and execute permission for runnable scripts.
- Document expected arguments and environment variables in comments.
- Prefer using `argparse` for Python scripts; run `shellcheck` on shell scripts.
