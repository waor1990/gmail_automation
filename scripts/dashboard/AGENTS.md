- **Responsibilities**:
  - Launch dashboard.
  - Generate reports (`ECAQ`, `Diff`) from command line.
  - Trigger data refresh via `python -m gmail_automation`.

### 3. `callbacks.py`

- **Role**: Core Dash callback logic.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle button actions: fix-case, remove-duplicates, sort, fix-all.
  - Synchronize table edits into internal config.
  - Persist updates to disk (with optional backup).
  - Recompute live reports and differences.
  - Update UI metrics, issues, and projections.

### 4. `layout.py`

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Render main dashboard layout and tables.
  - Provide editing controls for `SENDER_TO_LABELS`.

  - Validate SENDER_TO_LABELS entries for sorting, casing, and duplicates.
  - Compute diffs between current and expected label mappings.

### 7. `reports.py`

- **Role**: Report generation and diff projections.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Write human-readable ECAQ report.
  - Write machine-readable diff JSON for use in UI and downstream systems.

### 8. `utils_io.py`

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Read/write JSON safely.
  - Backup config files.
  - Ensure parent directories exist before writing.

## Notes

- All agents are designed to work independently and can be called from the CLI or UI.
- Reports are auto-refreshed on dashboard load and optionally via a refresh button.
- The entire state is round-trippable through JSON, enabling robust state persistence.
